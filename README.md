# Face-Recognition-using-open-CV-and-KNN-Algorith
Face recognition is a crucial security application. Through this project, a very basic form of face recognition has been implemented using the Haar Cascades Classifier, openCV &amp; K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm.
#Technology Stack
Python - The whole code has been written in Python cv2 - cv2 is the OpenCV module and is used here for reading & writing images & also to input a video stream Algorithm - KNN Classifier - Haar Cascades
#Dependencies
Python 2.7 and OpenCv
#How it works!
-Run generating selfie training data.ipynb.The script will open a camera window.Stand in front of the camera until recording of the face is completed.Input the person's name. Press q after having enough samples.
-The default file where the features are stored is name.npy.
-Run the Building Face Classifier.ipynb file!
